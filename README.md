# Spaced Out: Asteroid Mining Simulator

## About the Project

Spaced Out is an educational asteroid mining simulation project designed to explore the intersection of space technology, resource extraction, and financial modeling. This browser-based application aims to provide insights into the potential future of space-based mining operations.

## Project Goals

1. Demonstrate real-world applications of orbital mechanics and spectral analysis
2. Model resource extraction techniques in microgravity environments
3. Simulate market dynamics for space-derived resources
4. Explore scalable cloud architecture for complex simulations

## Features

- **Asteroid Mapping**: Procedurally generate asteroids based on real orbital data
- **Mining Simulation**: Model optical mining techniques for resource extraction
- **Economic Model**: Implement dynamic pricing based on supply and demand
- **User Interface**: Visualize mining operations and market trends

## How It Works

1. Select an asteroid from a map based on real astronomical data
2. Deploy virtual mining operations to extract resources
3. Monitor market fluctuations and sell extracted materials
4. Reinvest profits to improve mining efficiency

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (NumPy, Skyfield), Go (performance-critical calculations), FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Next with D3.js for data visualization
- **Hosting**: AWS Lambda, S3, RDS/PostgreSQL
- **Data Sources**: NASA JPL Small-Body Database, London Metal Exchange API

## Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Data Source |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Asteroid Generator | Create realistic asteroid models | NASA JPL orbits |
| Mining Simulator | Calculate resource extraction rates | Spectral data |
| Market Model | Simulate price dynamics | LME data, Monte Carlo simulations |
| Orbital Mechanics | Compute delta-V and trajectories | Skyfield ephemeris |

## Development Timeline

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Implement asteroid mapping and data retrieval
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Develop mining simulation and resource tracking
3. **Weeks 5-6**: Create economic model and market interface
4. **Weeks 7-8**: Build API layer and integrate components

## Note on Realism

While Spaced Out uses real astronomical data and economic principles, it is primarily an educational tool and not a precise representation of actual asteroid mining operations. The project simplifies complex concepts for the purpose of learning and exploration.

## Contributions

This project is currently a personal educational endeavor. However, feedback, suggestions, and discussions are welcome through the Issues section.

Remember: My goal is to learn, explore, and have a bit of fun along the way. No actual asteroids were harmed in the making of this simulator.
