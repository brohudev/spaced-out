## Priority 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
### Individual Satellite State Management
Priority: HIGHEST
Breakdown:
- Basic state object: position, health, power
- State transitions and validation
- Event logging system

Implementation:
```go
// Go for initial implementation
type SatelliteState struct {
    ID        string
    Position  OrbitalPosition
    Health    HealthStatus
    Power     PowerState
    LastUpdate time.Time
}

// Start with simple orbit calculations
type OrbitalPosition struct {
    Altitude    float64
    Inclination float64
    Phase       float64
}
```

## Priority 2: Networking (Weeks 5-8)
### P2P Communication System
Priority: HIGH
Breakdown:
- Basic message protocol
- Neighbor discovery
- Simple routing

Implementation:
```elixir
# Elixir for distributed communication
defmodule SatelliteNode do
  use GenServer
  
  def handle_message({:ping, from_node}) do
    # Basic ping/pong for neighbor discovery
  end
  
  def route_message(message, destination) do
    # Simple routing based on node distance
  end
end
```

## Priority 3: Ground Control (Weeks 9-12)
### Basic Dashboard
Priority: MEDIUM
Breakdown:
- State visualization
- Command interface
- Telemetry display

Implementation:
```zig
// Zig for performance-critical telemetry
pub fn processTelemetry(data: []const u8) !TelemetryPacket {
    // Fast packet processing
}
```

## Technical Approach Summary

1. Initial Development:
- Start with Go: Network setup, basic state management
- Add Elixir: Distributed communication, supervision
- Integrate Zig: Performance-critical components

2. Hardware Integration:
- Pi 4s: Main processing nodes
- Pi Zeros: Satellite simulators
- Arduino: Sensor simulation

1. Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for core logic
- Network simulation tests
- Hardware integration tests

## MVP Definition
Minimum features for first working version:
2. Two satellites communicating
3. Basic orbital position tracking
4. Simple dashboard showing states
5. Fundamental SDN configuration
